# Initializing an application
Initializing an application is easy. For Python it is not yet possible to create library stacks, but you can create a base app with:

```shell
cdk init app --language python
```

This will create a new directory `app` with a `cdk.json` file and a `requirements.txt` file. You'll need the cdk.json file so don't delete it!
